# PHPUnit-Koans #

PHP [Testing Koans](http://blog.code-cop.org/2015/12/testing-koans.html) to understand how to write unit tests with [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/).

## Dependencies ##

This is a [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) project.

Additional exercises cover [Hamcrest matchers](https://github.com/hamcrest/hamcrest-php).
Run `composer install` to install the required dependencies.

## Assignment ##

* Run tests with `phpunit` (or `vendor/bin/phpunit`).
* You should see some test failures and errors (but there are no assertions).
* Go through the test code starting from Session 1:
    * All assertions are commented and incomplete.
    * Uncomment the assertions and complete them making the tests pass.
    * You can run individual sessions using `phpunit test/Session1_GreeterTest.php`.
