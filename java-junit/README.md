# JUnit-Koans
Java [Testing Koans](http://blog.code-cop.org/2015/12/testing-koans.html) to understand how to write unit tests with [JUnit](http://junit.org/).

## Dependencies ##

* This is a Java 7 project.
* This is an [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) project.

Additional exercises cover [JUnitParams](http://pragmatists.github.io/JUnitParams/),
[Hamcrest](http://hamcrest.org/JavaHamcrest/),
[catchException](https://github.com/Codearte/catch-exception) and
[AssertJ](http://joel-costigliola.github.io/assertj/).

## Assignment ##

* Run tests with `mvnw test`.
* You should see some test failures and errors (but there are no assertions).
* Go through the test code starting from Session 1:
    * All assertions are commented and incomplete.
    * Uncomment the assertions and complete them making the tests pass.
    * You can run individual sessions using `mvnw test -Dtest=*1*`
