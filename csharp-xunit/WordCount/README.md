# C#-xUnit-Koans #

C# [Testing Koans](http://blog.code-cop.org/2015/12/testing-koans.html) to understand how to write unit tests with [xUnit.net](https://xunit.github.io/).

## Dependencies ##

This is a .NET Core 2.0 project. The programming language is C# 7.1 (Visual Studio 2017 version 15.3).

Additional exercises cover [NHamcrest](https://github.com/nhamcrest/NHamcrest) and [FluentAssertions](https://fluentassertions.com/). Run `dotnet restore` to install the dependencies.

## Assignment ##

* Run tests with `dotnet test` or script `run_tests`.
* You should see some test failures and errors (but there are no assertions).
* Go through the test code starting from Session 1:
    * All assertions are commented and incomplete.
    * Uncomment the assertions and complete them making the tests pass.
    * You can run individual sessions using `dotnet test --filter Session1`
