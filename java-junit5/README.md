# JUnit5-Koans
Java [Testing Koans](http://blog.code-cop.org/2015/12/testing-koans.html) to understand how to write unit tests with [JUnit 5](http://junit.org/junit5).

## Dependencies ##

* This is a Java 8 project.
* It supports both [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) and [Gradle](https://gradle.org).

Additional exercises cover [junit-jupiter-params](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-parameterized-tests),
[Hamcrest](http://hamcrest.org/JavaHamcrest/) and
[AssertJ](http://joel-costigliola.github.io/assertj/).

## Assignment ##

* Run tests with `mvnw test` or `gradlew test`.
* You should see some test failures and errors (but there are no assertions).
* Go through the test code starting from Session 1:
    * All assertions are commented and incomplete.
    * Uncomment the assertions and complete them making the tests pass.
    * You can run individual sessions using `mvnw test -Dtest=*1*`
