# JUnit-Koans
Java [Testing Koans](http://blog.code-cop.org/2015/12/testing-koans.html) to understand how to write unit tests with [JUnit 5](http://junit.org/junit5).

## Assignment ##

* This project supports both [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) and [Gradle](https://gradle.org).
* Running either `mvn test` or `gradlew test`, you should see some test failures and errors (but no assertions).
* Go through the test code starting from Session 1:
    * All assertions are commented and incomplete.
    * Uncomment the assertions and complete them making the tests pass.
